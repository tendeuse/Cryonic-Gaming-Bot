Shop destription


Below is a single shop.py cog that implements exactly what you specified, using non-persistent views and a fresh rebuild approach that is reliable on restarts:

On startup (when the cog loads and the bot is ready), it:

Ensures the 3 channels exist (ap-eve-shop, ap-shop-access, ap-shop-orders)

Clears ap-eve-shop and ap-shop-access

Posts one embed per item in both channels:

ap-eve-shop: Buy button

ap-shop-access: Add Stock, Remove Stock, Update Item, Remove Item

Posts a final “Shop Management” message in ap-shop-access with Add New Item

All operations (buy, stock changes, updates, removals) edit the existing embeds in place so stock/price/etc. is updated “in real time” without reposting.

With a /shop_rebuild slash command to rebuild on-demand

And a per-item “out of stock” disable Buy button behavior
